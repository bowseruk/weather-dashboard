![Mock up of the Webpage](assets/images/10-server-side-apis-challenge-demo.png)
* Use the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5) to retrieve weather data for cities.
* The base URL for your API calls should look like the following: `https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API key}`.
* The app must take a city from an input field completed by a user and convert it to a latitude and longitude.
* When a user searches for a city they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
  * When a user views the current weather conditions for that city they are presented with:
    * The city name
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
    * The wind speed
  * When a user view future weather conditions for that city they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays:
    * The date
    * An icon representation of weather conditions
    * The temperature
    * The humidity
  * When a user click on a city in the search history they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
* Uses `localStorage` to store persistent data.
